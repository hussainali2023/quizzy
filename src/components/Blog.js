          React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables
          the navigation among views of various components in a React
          Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync
          with the URL. Let us create a simple application to React to
          understand how the React Router works. The application will contain
          three components: home component, about a component, and contact
          component. We will use React Router to navigate between these
          components.
